# Proyect: Traffic Sign Classifier

---

## **Overview**

This is the second proyect of Nanodegree Self-Driving Car Engineer.

The objective of the project is built a classifier for traffic signs.

The classifier is a Convolutional Neural Network. The model is trained to classify traffic signals from the [German Traffic Signs Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

The project uses a version of the dataset provided by Udacity that is alredy resize to 32x32 pixels.
